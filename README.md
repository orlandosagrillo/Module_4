# Module_4
This Module details the necessary requirements to create an Analysis Notebook  The notebook will analyse and visualise the primary metrics of the portfolios provided,  determining which portfolio outperformed the others. The historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds will be utilised. the analysis will be used to create a custom portfolio of stocks, then the performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&amp;P TSX 60) will be compared.
